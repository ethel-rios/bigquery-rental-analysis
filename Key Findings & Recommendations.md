## Conclusion

### Rental Prices Distribution Across Municipalities

Rental prices vary significantly across different municipalities in the metropolitan area:

- Zapopan and Guadalajara have the highest price ranges for both houses and departments, featuring a mix of both mid-range and high-end properties.
Tlajomulco de Zúñiga and Tonalá have lower and more concentrated price distributions, making them more affordable areas.
Limited data in Tlajomulco de Zúñiga and Tonalá suggests that further data collection is necessary to confirm these trends.

### Most Influential Factors Affecting Rental Prices

The factors that influence the rent prices the most are the neighborhood and property area. 

- **Correlation Analysis:** A correlation matrix revealed that property area (m²) plays a significant role in rental pricing, but the strength of this relationship varies across locations: Zapopan and Tlajomulco de Zúñiga show the strongest correlation between area and price, meaning larger properties tend to have higher rents. Guadalajara exhibits a moderate correlation. Tonalá has the weakest correlation, nevertheless further analysis is required to validate this finding.

- **Average Price by neighborhood:** Zapopan and Guadalajara exhibit significant price variation, with some neighborhoods offering high-end properties and others providing more affordable options, reflecting a diverse rental market. In contrast, Tonalá and Tlajomulco offer more budget-friendly housing options, with lower average rental prices and costs per m². This shows how the location within each municipality, as well as proximity to desirable amenities, can dramatically influence rent levels, making the neighborhood a key factor in pricing.


### Variability in Neighborhood Pricing

- **ANOVA Test Results:** The ANOVA results demonstrate that neighborhood is a key factor influencing rental prices in these municipalities. The strong statistical significance suggests that understanding neighborhood-level price variation is crucial for analyzing and predicting rental prices. However, the extreme results in Tonalá warrant further investigation to ensure data quality and avoid misinterpretation.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis:

#### Expanding the Dataset for More Balanced Municipality Representation

One limitation of this analysis is the underrepresentation of Tlajomulco de Zúñiga and Tonalá. A more balanced dataset would:

- Improve Statistical Reliability: Ensuring that conclusions about rental trends in each municipality are based on a sufficiently large sample.
- Enhance Neighborhood-Level Insights: More data from less represented neighborhoods would refine the understanding of price variations.
- Increase Model Accuracy: Predictive models would perform better with a more diverse and evenly distributed dataset.
